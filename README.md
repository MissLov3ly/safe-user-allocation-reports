# Community Challenge: Identify Airdrop Farmers

The proposed list of SAFE user allocations has been published on the [Safe forum](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/new-proposal-reworked-safe-distribution-for-users/594).

Since the conditions have been lowered quite a bit compared to the original proposal, there is a chance that airdrop farmers took advantage of this. We would like to offer the Safe community a chance to detect those addresses. 

This repo is meant to collect and approve/reject reports.


## Reporting a group of Safes created by airdrop farmers

To report a group of Safes, [create an issue](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-user-allocation-reports/issues/new) on this repo and use the provided issue template.

#### Rules:
- Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis.
- Reports must contain at least 10 Safe addresses still in `safe_user_allocations_reworked.csv` at the time of review.
- The methodology and reasoning why the Safes are airdrop farming must be well explained and easy to understand.
- Methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered. When in doubt, we opt for ‚Äúthis is legit usage‚Äù.
- *Successful submissions receive 25% of the ‚Äúsaved‚Äù SAFE when providing a valid mainnet Safe address.* Remaining 75% is redistributed to the rest of the eligible Safes.
- Reports have to be submitted to Github before September 19, 2022 00:00:00 CEST.
- Report acceptance / rejection is at the sole discretion of the Safe team.

##### Happy hunting üèπ
