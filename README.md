# SAFE user allocation reports

The proposed list of SAFE user allocations has bee published on the [Safe forum](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/new-proposal-reworked-safe-distribution-for-users/594).

Since the conditions have been lowered quite a bit compared to the original proposal, there is a chance that airdrop hunters took advantage of this. We would like to offer the Safe community a chance to detect those addresses. 

This repo is meant to collect and approve/reject reports.


## Reporting a group of Safes created by airdrop hunters

To report a group of Safes, create an issue on this repo and use the provided issue template.

#### Rules:
* Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis.
* Reports must contain at least 10 Safe addresses still in `safe_user_allocations_reworked.csv` at the time of review.
* The methodology and reasoning must be well explained and easy to understand. 
* Methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered. When in doubt, we opt for ‚Äúthis is legit usage‚Äù.
* Multiple Safes need to be submitted that all use a similar pattern
* Successful submissions receive 25% of the ‚Äúsaved‚Äù SAFE when providing a valid mainnet Safe address. Remaining 75% is redistributed to the rest of the eligible Safes.
* Reports have to be submitted to Github before September 19, 2022 00:00:00 CEST.
* Report acceptance / rejection is at the sole discretion of the Safe core team.


##### Happy hunting üèπ
